Degree Program Hours: 120
The Bachelor of Science program in Computer Science is
accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of
ABET https://www.abet.org
Students must follow regular University admission
procedures and upon admission declare their specific
major as Computer Science. Two tracks are available in
the program. The Computer Science track should be
followed by the student who intends to continue to
graduate study in computer science. The Software
Design and Development track may be followed by the
student who intends to pursue a software engineering
career.
All required courses must be completed with a grade of
"C" or better. All students must participate in KFSCIS
assessment activities and successfully complete an exit
interview prior to graduation.
Lower Division
Students must complete the following courses as part of
their course work, preferably during the first 60 credits and
complete COP 2210 with a grade of “C” or higher:
